Event Parser Design Kata
============================

For better understanding that how you set up your tests changes the design of your production code.

Instructions
------------

This repo contains no production code right now. However, there are 
several unit tests to choose from. All the unit tests are for the 
same scenario/user story, which is described below. Before you write
any code, read the code for the different options and decide on
pros and cons of each one.

Then, without changing the test code, implement each one in turn.
Use the tests one at a time to test-drive several implementations.

Each implemementation has a slightly different design in the production code.

  - Which design was easiest to implement?
  - Which design do you like best?
  - Did you predict that from just reading the tests? 


The user story
--------------

You have a report produced by another system, which details all the products 
available at a particular store. The user wants to see a list of all the 
Store Events - their names and their prices.
